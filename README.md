## 以下是原 README

For all the completionists out there, I created a tool that helps you track your in-game progress directly from your savefile.


## ⚙️ Usage

🔗 **Try it here:** [silksong-completionist.com](https://silksong-completionist.com/)

Using the analyzer is simple!

Just drag and drop your savefile into the upload box on the site, or click the box to browse and upload it.

If you’re unsure where your savefile is located, the savefile paths for most platforms are conveniently listed right above the upload area.

Once uploaded, the analyzer will automatically parse your data and display your progress towards 100% completion.
